## Description

> Challenge #18- NoSQL Social Media Back-End

---

## Introduction 
We were instructed to create the back end of a social media website using NoSQL. We needed to set up an API with routes referring to the 'User' and then the ability to create a 'Thought' as well as leave a 'Reaction'. 

The User routes include:
- GET all Users
- GET User by ID
- CREATE User
- UPDATE User by ID
- DELETE User by ID

The Thought and Reaction routes include:
- GET all Thoughts 
- GET Thought by ID
- CREATE a new Thought
- UPDATE Thought by ID
- UPDATE a Thought by PUTTING a Reaction
- DELETE a Thought by ID
- DELETE a Reaction by UPDATING a Thought

---

## Challenges
I ran into issues with the reactions and the deleting of reactions. I had help from Kelley and Jessica to get it working.

## Victories

I was able to get the controllers and servers routed mostly correct
